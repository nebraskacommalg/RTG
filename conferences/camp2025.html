Summer CAMP is a professional development workshop to be held Tuesday through Thursday, <b>August 12&ndash;14, 2025</b>, at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The workshop is
  aimed at early-career mathematicians with research interests in commutative algebra and related fields. During this three full day event, we will discuss academic and noncareers careers, with a
  focus on what happens before, during, and after the job application process. We have invited experts with different kinds of professional experience to talk about these topics;
  all experts have a background in commutative algebra. There will also be dedicated workshop time everyday for the participants to work on their application materials, giving them
  a chance to apply the advice they received in real time and to receive one-on-one feedback from the experts. Here are some of the topics that will be discussed:

<ul>

<li>The job application process (in both academia and outside of academia)</li>

<li>How to prepare a job talk</li>

<li>How to prepare for job interviews (in both academia and outside of academia)</li>

<li>How to negotiate a job offer </li>

<li>Applying for grants</li>

<li>What the day-to-day life of our nonacademic experts is like</li>

</ul>

Here are some of the materials from the workshop:

<ul>

<li><a href=intro.pdf>Intro slides</a></li> 

<li><a href=dictionary.pdf>Job search dictionary</a></li>

<li><a href=statements.pdf>A short intro to academic job statements</a></li>

</ul>

If you would like access to the other materials we produced for the workshop, please contact the organizers directly.

All participants will have their hotel covered. We also have funding to cover travel for some, but not all, of the participants; if you (or your advisor, mentor, department,
university) have funds that can cover your travel, we will appreciate it if you can use that funding. The deadline to apply is <u>June 15, 2025</u>, though priority might be given to
those who apply early.


<br>
Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accommodate 
all applicants.

Final decisions regarding funding will be made by the end of June. -->

<u>Abstracts:</u>

<b>Branden Stone</b> (Georgia Tech Research Institute)
<br>
<br>
Life as a defense contractor and the math used
<br><br>
Abstract: DoD projects have a wide variety of applications. As such, the technology needed is not limited to particular fields. Throughout this talk we will discuss the 
expectations and work cycle of a defense contractor at GTRI. Furthermore, we will highlight some engineering tools and mathematical principles utilized.

<b>Jonathan Monta&ntilde;o</b> (Arizona State University)
<br>
<br>
Multiplicities and Volumes: An interplay among Algebra, Combinatorics, and Geometry
<br><br>
Abstract: The notion of multiplicity in algebra traces back to the work of Samuel in 1951 in connections with intersection theory of algebraic varieties. Since then, multiple generalizations of Samuel's multiplicity have been introduced and a wide-ranging set of applications have been found to other topics in mathematics such as: mixed volumes in discrete geometry and degrees in algebraic geometry.  Multiplicities are closely related to the theory of convex bodies, and this relation is an active research topic lying in the interaction of Commutative Algebra, Combinatorics, and Algebraic Geometry. In this talk we will discuss some of the history of this topic and its applications. We also report on recent results in joint work with Federico Castillo, Yairon Cid-Ruiz, Binglin Li, Fatemeh Mohammadi, and Naizhen Zhang. In one of these results, we show that mixed volumes of arbitrary convex bodies can be interpreted algebraically as mixed multiplicities of graded families of monomial ideals. In another result, we present a complete characterization of the positivity of multidegrees of multiprojective algebraic varieties and establish a combinatorial description using convex geometry. We also use our methods to prove that double Schubert polynomials have Saturated Newton Polytopes, which settles a conjecture by Monical, Tokcan and Yong.

This is the same job talk Jonathan used during his most recent job search.

<b>Adam Boocher</b> (University of San Diego)
<br>
<br>
There's a Hilbert Function in this Talk
<br><br>
Abstract: I'll tell a story about Magic Squares and a theorem of Stanley.  Along the way, I'll discuss how parts of this story appeared in job talks of various sorts.

<b>Travel information:</b>

<br>

The University of Nebraska-Lincoln is located in Lincoln, Nebraska. If you live within driving distance, we strongly encourage you to drive to Lincoln. If you need to fly, there is an airport in Lincoln, and the Omaha airport is about an hour away by car. The <a href=https://www.omalink.com>OmaLink shuttle</a> provides transportation between the Omaha airport and Lincoln, but it is unfortunately quite expensive. A one way uber costs typically around &dollar;100; we might be able to cover a few uber rides to and from the Omaha airport, but only if there is a group of participants sharing it. We strongly encourage participants to fly to Lincoln instead.


<br><br>

<b>CHAMPS:</b>

<br>


<a href=https://eloisagrifo.github.io/champ/>CHAMPS</a> gives graduate students and other early career researchers on the academic job market a platform to showcase their research. You can see elevator pitch videos introducing the research of former CHAMPS on the <a href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnh5vdfU5zP7q9OqBkix0TA>CHAMPS YouTube Channel</a>.
