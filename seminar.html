<h3>King's conjecture and the secondary fan</h3>
</center>

Abstract: 
In 1997 King conjectured that each smooth projective toric variety has a
"full strong exceptional collection of line bundles," or a collection
which forms a sort of basis for all graded modules over its coordinate
ring with respect to its irrelevant ideal.  The conjecture is false, but
has motivated recent work in removing the dependence on irrelevant ideal
by considering the secondary fan of the toric variety.  I will discuss a
version of King's conjecture which my coauthors and I have proven in
this case.

<h3>GKZ-systems, classical and with torsion</h3>

</center>

Abstract: 
A GKZ (or "A-hypergeometric")  system arises from rather little information: a finite set of points A in a free Abelian group of rank d, and a vector beta of d complex numbers. An
fancier way of saying this is: a finite collection of torus characters, and a Lie algebra morphism to the complex numbers. In the talk, I will show how to write down these systems,
give a woefully incomplete picture of how to think about them, and explain why they can be thought of as systems of linear partial differential equations. Borrowing words of
Prospero, (hopefully) no harm will be done (to upstanding algebraists) in the process.  <br> <br>

One of the more elementary aspects that  a system of PDEs offers is its "rank", the dimension of its solution space. While typically infinite, GKZ systems have finite rank because they "come from geometry". I'll discuss how this number changes when A is fixed and beta varies. The discussion will involve Koszul-like complexes and local cohomology.  <br><br>

The names attached to the featured results up to here are Gel'fand, Gra'ev, Kapranov, Zelevinsky, Adolphson, Sturmfels, Miller, Matusevich, myself, and this part of the story is now considered "classical".  <br><br>

At the end, I hope to say something new: what happens when A is an Abelian group that has torsion. (This generalization has been introduced by Borisov and Horja on behalf of mirror
symmetrists.)  <br><br>

After the end, I might mention how the story seems to work out when the torus is replaced by a more general Lie group. Such things were introduced by Yao, Liang, and Song.  <br><br>

The non classical things I might say were obtained with G&ouml;rlach, Reichelt, Sevenheck and Steiner.

<h3>Customizing closure operations</h3>
</center>

Abstract: Closure operations, such as integral closure and tight
closure, are used in commutative algebra to describe singularities and
prove properties of commutative rings. In this talk I will discuss key
properties of closure operations and how to create closures that have
them. I will also describe a generalization of the duality between
tight closure and its test ideal that allows us to connect many
closure operations to singularity types such as F-regular and
F-rational and their equivalents in other characteristics. Parts of
this work are joint with Neil Epstein, Zhan Jiang, Peter McDonald,
Karl Schwede, and Janet Vassilev.

<h3>Proxy small thick subcategories of derived categories</h3>
</center>

Abstract: Let R be a commutative noetherian ring. Let D be the bounded derived category of finitely generated R-modules. In this talk, we will first recall the definition and present a couple of examples of proxy small objects of D in the sense of Dwyer, Greenlees and Iyengar. Then we will extend proxy small objects to proxy small thick subcategories. Finally,
under a certain assumption on R, we will give a complete classification of the proxy small thick subcategories of D in terms of specialization-closed subsets of Spec R.

<h3>Artinian Gorenstein algebras having binomial Macaulay dual generator</h3>
</center>

Abstract: Every graded artinian Gorenstein ring corresponds via Macaulay-Matlis duality to a homogeneous polynomial, called a Macaulay dual generator. In this way, Macaulay dual generators which are monomials correspond to monomial complete intersection rings. Monomial complete intersections have particularly nice properties: their natural generators form a Gr&ouml;bner basis, their minimal free resolutions are well understood, and  they satisfy the strong Lefschetz property (in characteristic zero).  

<br><br>

In this talk we consider Macaulay dual generators which are the difference of two monomials and we seek to understand to what extent the properties listed above still persist for the corresponding artinian Gorenstein algebras. This is joint work with Nasrin Altafi, Rodica Dinu, Sara Faridi, Shreedevi K. Masuti, Rosa M. Mir&oacute;-Roig, and Nelly Villamizar.

<br><br>

This talk is 95&percnt; identical to the one I gave at Notre Dame two weeks before. Anyone who has seen that talk is of course excused.

<h3>Loewy lengths of modules of finite projective dimension</h3>
</center>
Abstract: Suppose R is a local Noetherian ring with maximal ideal m. An R-module M has finite length if m<sup>i</sup> M = 0 for some positive integer i. The minimum i such that m<sup>i</sup> M = 0 is defined to be the Loewy length of M, denoted &#8467;&#8467;(M). Assuming the associated graded ring is Cohen-Macaulay, we will sketch a proof of the following result: if M also has finite projective dimension, then &#8467;&#8467;(M) is at least &#8467;&#8467;(R/x) where x = x<sub>1</sub>, .. , x<sub>d</sub> any sufficiently general linear system of parameters on R. This is joint work with Josh Pollitz.

<h3>Rational Powers and Summation Formula </h3>
</center>


Abstract: In commutative algebra, the summation formula is well studied. Musta&#355;&#259; in 02 proved a summation formula for multiplier ideals, which was generalized by Takagi in 06. In recent work, H&agrave;, Nguyen, Trung, Trung'20, and H&agrave, Jayanthan, Kumar, and Nguyen proved the summation formula for symbolic powers. Banerjee and H&agrave proved that the summation formula holds for rational powers of monomial ideals in different polynomial rings. In a recent project, S. Das, T. H. H&agrave, J. Monta&ntilde;o, and I investigated the summation formula for rational powers. In that project, we introduced the concept of the Rees package, which ensures the summation formula for rational powers. In this talk, I will describe the necessary terms with examples. I will also describe the classes of ideals that satisfy the summation formula for rational powers. I will discuss some results from the joint work with S. Das, T. H. H&agrave;, and J. Monta&ntilde;o.

<h3>Interpolation in weighted projective spaces</h3>
</center>
There are no pre-requisites for this talk besides some elementary knowledge of algebra, a curious mind and a 55 minute attention span. Everyone is welcome!<br>
Over an algebraically closed field, the double point interpolation problem asks for the vector space dimension of the projective hypersurfaces of degree d singular at a given set of points. 
After being open for 90 years, a series of papers by J. Alexander and A. Hirschowitz in 1992&dash;1995 settled this question in what is referred to as the Alexander-Hirschowitz theorem. In this talk, we use commutative algebra to prove analogous statements in the <i>weighted projective space</i>, a natural generalization of the projective space. I will also introduce an inductive procedure for weighted projective planes, similar to that originally due to A. Terracini from 1915, to demonstrate an example of a weighted projective plane where the analogue of the Alexander-Hirschowitz theorem holds without exceptions and prove our example is the only such plane. Furthermore, I will give interpolation bounds for an infinite family of weighted projective planes.

<h3>Toward a Zariski-Nagata Theorem for Smooth, Complete Toric Surfaces</h3>
</center>

Abstract: The Zariski-Nagata theorem is a classical result which expresses the nth symbolic power of a radical ideal I in a polynomial ring over a perfect field in terms of the nth regular powers of the maximal ideals in mSpec(I). In this talk I will discuss a well-known Zariski-Nagata analog for projective varieties. I will also give a brief crash course on toric varieties and their relationship with projective varieties, and I will discuss my recent progress on developing a Zariski-Nagata type theorem for smooth, complete toric surfaces.

<h3>Cartier algebras through the lens of p-families</h3>
</center>

Abstract: A Cartier subalgebra of a prime characteristic commutative ring R is an associated non-commutative ring of operators on R that play nicely with the Frobenius map. When R is Gorenstein local, its Cartier subalgebras correspond exactly with sequences of ideals called F-graded systems. One special subclass of F-graded system is called a p-family; these appear in numerical applications such as the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity and the F-signature. In this talk, I will discuss how to characterize some properties of a Cartier subalgebra in terms of its F-graded system. I will further present a way to construct, for an arbitrary F-graded system, a closely related p-family with especially nice properties.

<h3>Seshadri constants on blow ups of ruled surfaces.</h3>
</center>

Abstract: Let X be a projective variety, and let L be an ample line bundle on X. For a point x in X, the Seshadri constant of L at x is defined as the infimum, taken over all curves C passing through x, of the ratios \(\frac{L.C}{m}\), where L.C denotes the intersection product of L and C, and m is the multiplicity of C at x. This concept was introduced by J.-P. Demailly in 1990, inspired by Seshadri's ampleness criterion. 
Seshadri constants provide insights into both the local behavior of L at x and certain global properties of X. We will give an overview of the current research in this area and discuss some recent results on Seshadri constants of line bundles on blow ups of ruled surfaces.

<h3>Betti tables forcing failure of the weak Lefschetz property</h3>
</center>

Abstract: For most rings, a lot of the data of the ring can be captured via its (minimal) free resolution, in turn summarized by a Betti table. If such a ring is also Artinian, the ring is said to have the weak Lefschetz property (WLP) if multiplication by some linear form is always full rank. Joint with Hal Schenck, we show that if the Betti table of an Artinian algebra has a certain substructure resembling a Koszul complex, then the Artinian algebra cannot have the WLP.

<h3>Cellular resolutions of lattice ideals</h3>
</center>

Abstract: A sublattice of &#8484;<sup>n</sup> can be used to construct a binomial ideal in the
polynomial ring of n variables.  I will discuss a construction of Bayer
and Sturmfels which relates the free resolution of such an ideal to the
free resolution of a monomial model.  In some cases of interest to me
the monomial module can then be resolved using a cell complex.

<h3>Koszul Binomial Edge Ideals</h3>
</center>

Abstract: Koszul algebras are an important family of algebras appearing at the intersection of commutative algebra, combinatorics, and topology, which possess many desirable properties. Given an arbitrary quadratic algebra, it is generally difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether the algebra is Koszul. Thus, finding families of algebras which are Koszul is a challenging and interesting question. In this talk, I will introduce Koszul algebras and present on joint work with Matt Mastroeni, Jason McCullough, and Irena Peeva, where we characterize the Koszul binomial edge ideals in terms of the combinatorics of the underlying graph.

<h3>An Introduction to Gr&ouml;bner Bases and Their Applications</h3>

Abstract: Computations are a powerful tool in commutative algebra, and the foundation of many important computations is Gr&ouml;bner bases. In this talk I will define the necessary background to understand what Gr&ouml;bner bases are and go over how to compute them. I will discuss how Gr&ouml;bner bases can be used to solve fundamental problems, with a focus on The Ideal Membership Problem and The Implicitization Problem.

<h3>Detecting finite projective dimension with Frobenius pushforwards</h3>
</center>

Abstract: Let \(R\) be a commutative Noetherian local ring of characteristic \(p\).  For a positive integer \(e\), let \(F_*^e R\) denote the ring \(R\) viewed as an \(R\)-module through the \(e\) iteration of the Frobenius endomorphism.   If \(M\) is a module of finite projective dimension, a classic result of Peskine and Szpiro says that \(\operatorname{Tor}_i^R(F_*^e R, M)=0\) for all positive integers \(i\) and \(e\).  Later, Koh and Lee proved a strong converse: there exists an integer \(e\) (depending only on the ring) such that for any finitely generated $R$-module, if \(\operatorname{Tor}_i^R(F_*^e R, M)=0\) for \(\operatorname{depth} R+1\) consecutive values of \(i>0\), then \(M\) has finite projective dimension.   Can this result be extended to arbitrary modules? How about for non-local rings?   In this talk, we give an affirmative answer to these questions if \(R\) is essentially of finite type over a local ring.

<h3>Maximal Cohen-Macaulay DG-Modules</h3>
</center>

Abstract: In commutative algebra, maximal Cohen-Macaulay complexes over a noetherian local ring are a natural generalization of maximal Cohen-Macaulay module. In 2018, Iyengar, Ma, Schwede, and Walker showed that for a noetherian local ring with a dualizing complex, the existence of a maximal Cohen-Macaulay complex is equivalent to the Canonical Element Theorem (and so maximal Cohen-Macaulay complexes exist over such rings). Recently, I've been working on extending results in commutative algebra to derived commutative algebra, where the objects of study are DG-rings (differential graded algebras that share some similarities to noetherian local rings) and DG-modules over these DG-rings.  In my talk, I'll go over a potential definition for a maximal Cohen-Macaulay DG-module that is inspired by Iyengar, Ma, Schwede, and Walker's work, and will sketch out some results that I've obtained about these DG-modules.

<h3>Basic Monomial Ideals </h3>
</center>

Abstract: An ideal is called basic if it does not contain a smaller ideal with the same integral closure. In this talk, we investigate when a monomial ideal is basic. Using methods from convex geometry, we provide a clear characterization of basic monomial ideals, highlighting the similarities between the algebraic and geometric structure. We also discuss a method of calculating analytic spread with convex geometry.

<h3>97 years after Macaulay</h3>
</center>

Abstract: In 1927, Macaulay's paper on lex ideals was published. Macaulay proved that for every homogeneous ideal in a polynomial ring, there exists a nicely structured ideal (called a lex ideal) with the same Hilbert function. This is the fundamental result on Hilbert function and has influenced both algebra and combinatorics throughout the last century. Unfortunately, the fields that Macaulay founded and influenced have developed separately since the publication of the Clements-Lindstr&ouml;m Theorem in 1969.
<br>
This talk will be about a connection between extremal combinatorics and commutative algebra that will put everything into a single framework. There are several byproducts from this connection. I will deduce old and new results in both fields that give answers to questions posed by Bezrukov, Hoefel, Leck, Mermin and Peeva. Some of these results include other rings in which Macaulay's lex ideal theorem holds, and a classification in this direction.

<h3>Symmetric group fixed quotients of polynomial rings</h3>
</center>

Abstract: Let the symmetric group act on the polynomial ring S in n variables via variable permutation. We consider the quotient module M which sets a monomial equal to all of its images under the action. This is a module over the ring of invariants, with relatively little known about its structure. When using integer coefficients, we can embed M as an ideal inside the ring of symmetric polynomials. Doing so gives rise to a family of ideals - one for each n. Localizing at a prime p reveals striking behavior in these ideals, which stay stable (in a sense) as n grows, but jump in complexity each time n equals a multiple of p. In this talk, we will discuss the construction of this family of ideals, as well as a result and conjecture on its structure. The talk will end with a path forward towards solving the conjecture.
