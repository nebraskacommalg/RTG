RTG Learning Seminar, Spring 2026: Koszul Algebras

</h1>
</center>


<h3><center>
          We meet ????????????
</center></h3>

During the Spring 2026 semester, Adam LaClair will be leading the first RTG Learning Seminar. In this seminar, graduate students, post-docs and faculty will take turns
presenting material covering various topics centering on a general theme. It will be similar to the CMinar we ran in the Spring of 2025 (but it will last the entire semester, and will
be on a different
topic.) The goal is to learn a focused topic in great depth, with the aspiration of getting the participants  up to speed on the cutting edge status of a research topic, and perhaps even
sparking some new research projects.


The topic of this semester's Learning Seminar will be Koszul Algebras.  Here is a tentative (and incomplete) list of specific topics we plan to discuss:



  <h1> Topics: </h1>
  <ul>

<li> Introduction to Koszul algebras and properties: Priddy resolution, Avramov-Eisenbud-Peeva regularity characterization, rational Poincare series <br>
<li> Proving Koszulness: Quadratic Grobner bases, Froberg's theorem, LG quadratic, Koszul filtrations 
<li> Examples of Koszul algebras: Quadratic complete intersections, high Veronese algebras, pinched Veroneses (sometimes), quadratic Gorenstein algebras (sometimes), strongly
    chordal and claw-free binomial edge ideals 
<li> Other interesting examples: Anick's examples of irrational Poincaré series, Conca's strictness-of-implication examples, Roos's nonlinear syzygies examples, D’Alì–Venturello
    examples of dependence on characteristic 
<li>  Conjectures: Bounds on Betti numbers, Bogvad's conjecture, Veroneses of non-standard graded polynomial rings 
  </ul>
