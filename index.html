<h2>Programs</h2>


<!--
<h3>RTG postdoctoral trainees</h3>

We will be hiring an RTG postdoc to start in August 2025. Review of applications will begin on December 2, 2024. Please apply on <a href=https://www.mathjobs.org/jobs/list/25729>mathjobs</a>.
Please direct any questions to <a href=mailto:mark.walker@unl.edu>Mark Walker</a>.
-->




<h3>RTG Seminar</h3> 
<par>
Each RTG postdoc will run a year-long research seminar in their 
second year (years 2, 3, and 5), vertically integrating their 
research and teaching activities with those of our faculty and 
graduate trainees. The RTG seminar will have a year-long focus 
on an area of current interest. The Fall semester will be 
centered on covering the background, and the Spring semester 
will be a workshop in which students, postdocs, and faculty 
work together on research problems. The goal will be to 
publish original results or expository papers in a suitable 
journal, with work continuing beyond the academic year. 
Participants will produce materials to be publicly shared 
on the RTG website, including lecture notes from seminar talks.
</par>
<par>
The RTG postdoc will co-direct their RTG seminar with a 
faculty member. They will choose a topic in which the postdoc 
has some experience, and they will co-direct the discussions 
and the selection of problems to consider. The postdoc will 
gain experience as a research mentor for students. By
including others in their program, the RTG seminar will 
accelerate the postdoc's research; the faculty advisor 
will help ensure that the postdoc is not sacrificing their 
own research program in the process.
</par>
<par>
Participation in the RTG seminar will be open to anyone 
who is interested, though RTG graduate trainees will take 
a central role and be required to give talks. The co-directors 
will help students prepare their talks. This will help graduate 
students transition from learning to research, further their 
communication skills, and help advanced students expand the 
breadth of their research.

<h3>Professional Development Workshop</h3>
<par>In 2025, 2027, and 2029, we will host <a href=conferences/camp2025.html>Summer CAMP</a>, a workshop for graduate 
students and postdocs in algebra (broadly construed) from across 
the US. We will focus on professional development with the aim 
of equipping participants with practical tools they need to be 
as competitive as possible in the job market, both for academic 
and nonacademic career paths. Activities will include workshops 
on curating websites, creating job application materials, 
crafting elevator pitches for mathematicians and the general 
public, and framing the broader impacts of one's research 
within societal and world challenges. It will also include 
panels with junior and senior faculty members, including 
someone who has served on a search committee, and a nonacademic mathematician.
</par>

  
<h3><a href=conferences/reu.html>International REU</a></h3>
<par>This REU will be held at CIMAT, in Guanajuato, Mexico, in Summer 2025 and Summer 2028. 
This program will enable 10 US citizen undergraduate students 
recruited from institutions across the US to interact with commutative 
algebra experts from the US and Mexico and experience international research collaboration.

<h3>First Generation First Year Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)</h3>
<par>Each summer, four undergraduates who are first generation college students 
will participate in a 4-week long program. Students will be introduced 
to the basics of proof writing, coding, and relevant foundational material, 
and work on a small research question. Preference will be given to 
incoming freshmen, with the goal of maximizing retention. The REU 
students will be primarily guided by two of the RTG Graduate Trainees, 
with support from a faculty member. Several of our current graduate 
students are first generation college students, and they would be 
excellent role models and mentors for the REU students; this will 
also be a professional development opportunity for the RTG Trainees.
