RTG Learning Seminar, Spring 2026: Koszul Algebras

</h1>
</center>


<h3><center>
          Mondays, 2:30-3:20, in Avery 351
</center></h3>

During the Spring 2026 semester, Adam LaClair, with the help of Elo&iacute;sa Grifo and Mark Walker,
will be leading the first RTG Learning Seminar. In this seminar, graduate
students, post-docs and faculty will take turns presenting material covering various topics centering on a general
theme. It will be similar to the CMinar we ran in the Spring of 2025 (but it will last the entire semester, and will be
on a different topic.) The goal is to learn a focused topic in great depth, with the aspiration of getting the
participants up to speed on the cutting edge status of a research topic, and perhaps even sparking some new research
projects.


The topic of this semester's Learning Seminar will be Koszul Algebras.  Here is a tentative list of
specific topics we plan to discuss:

Resources

<ul>
  <li>January 26: In McCullough-Peeva, p.243-4 they introduce the quadratic dual and have some examples, and p.244-5, they use this to define the Priddy resolution and present an example.
      In Beilinson, Ginzburg, Soergel, p. 483, 2.6 and 2.6.1, they introduce the Priddy complex and prove that it is a resolution when the ring is Koszul. </li>
  <li>February 2: In Beilinson, Ginzburg, Soergel, Section 2.11, they give a proof of this result. A proof that Koszul implies the stated equality is given in 
      L&oumlfwall, ``Hilbert series, Poincaré series and homotopy Lie algebras of graded algebras — a seminar," Section 1.2. Another proof that the stated equality implies that the ring is Koszul is
      given in L&oumlfwall, ``On the subalgebra generated by the one dimensional elements in the Yoneda Ext algebra," Theorem 1.2, p.305. </li>
  <li>February 9: The relevant paper is Fr&oumlberg's paper ``Koszul algebras." </li>
  <li>February 16: The relevant paper is Tate's paper ``Homology of Noetherian Local Rings." </li>
  <li>February 23: The relevant paper is Roos-Sturmfel's paper, ``A toric ring with irrational Poincar&eacute series." We would like to understand the reduction steps in Section 3. Specifically, 
  we would like to see large homomorphisms in the sense of Levin, ``Large homomorphisms of local rings." Golod maps and implication on Poincar&eacute series. In 
      L&oumlfwall, ``Hilbert series, Poincar&eacute series and homotopy Lie algebras of graded algebras — a seminar," Section 2.3, an introduction to the Poincar&eacute-Birkhoff-Witt is given. </li>
  <li>March 2: The relevant paper is Roos-Sturmfel's paper, ``A toric ring with irrational Poincar&eacute series." </li>
  <li>March 9: The relevant paper is Avramov-Eisenbud, ``Regularity of Modules over a Koszul Algebra."  Given sufficient time it would also be nice to cover the proof of Corollary 2, 
      whose proof is in Eisenbud-Goto. </li>
  <li>March 16: No meeting. </li>
  <li>March 23: The relevant paper is Avramov-Peeva, ``Finite Regularity and Koszul Algebras". </li>
  <li>March 30: The relevant paper is Conca, ``Koszul algebras and their syzygies," p. 8 - 10 and Definition 3.6.   </li>
  <li>April 6: The relevant paper is Conca, Trung, Valla, ``Koszul Property for Points in Projective Spaces," p. 201-6. </li>
  <li>April 13: The relevant paper is Conca, ``Koszul algebras and their syzygies," Section 3.1, p. 18 - 20. </li>
  <li>April 20: The relevant paper is Roos, ``Commutative Non Koszul Algebras Having a Linear Resolution of Arbitrary High Order," p.1123-6. </li>
  <li>April 27: The relevant paper is McCullough-Seceleanu, ``Quadratic Gorenstein Algebras," Section 5. </li>
